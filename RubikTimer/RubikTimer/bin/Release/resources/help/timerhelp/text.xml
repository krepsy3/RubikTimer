The phase section displays the timing phase. For more information, please reffer to chapter "Timer function".&lt;LineBreak /&gt;The statistic section displays multiple statistics composed from your solving times. For more information, please reffer to chapter "Statistics".&lt;LineBreak /&gt;The scramble section generates and displays scrambles. For more information, please reffer to chapter "Scramble generator".&lt;LineBreak /&gt;Another small section, the menus (1) handles The file system functions (File) - reffer to chapter "Statistics - saving", The puzzle selection (Select Puzzle) - reffer to chapter "Scramble generator" and displays this help window and the about window (Help) - reffer to chapter "Other".&lt;LineBreak /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Cambria" FontSize="24" Name="controls"&gt;&lt;Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;&lt;TextDecoration Location="Underline" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;Controls overview&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;This chapter features an ultimate summary of all of the functions and their key combinations. For the function description, please reffer to the chapter from the square brackets, respectively.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph TextAlignment="Left" FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;• Confirm - Enter&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• Cancel - Esc&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Other] Exit - Alt + F4 or button in "File" menu (1)&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Other] View Help window (this) - F1&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Other] View About Window - F2&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Other] Zoom in/out - Ctrl + mouse wheel up/down in about or help window&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Timer function] Phase switching - Backspace&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Timer function] Timer start - Release Backspace&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Timer function] Timer Stop - Press Backspace&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Timer function] Reset phase - R&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Scramble generator] Generate scramble - Ctrl + G or button (10)&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Scramble generator] Select Puzzle - Press desired in "Select puzzle" menu (1)&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Statistics] View Statistic Items - Ctrl + Y or button (8)&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Statistics - view] Delete Last Statistic Item - Delete or button (13) in Statistic item view Window&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Statistics - saving] Create new Statistic file - Ctrl + N or button in "File" menu (1)&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Statistics - saving] Select another existing Statistic file - Ctrl + O or button in "File" menu (1)&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Statistics - saving] Save the currently selected statistic file - Ctrl + S or button in "File" menu (1)&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Statistics - saving] Change the folder with User Data - Ctrl + H or button in "File" menu (1)&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Statistics - saving] Open the folder with User Data - Ctrl + F or button in "File" menu (1)&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Statistics - saving] Trigger the saving statistic items to file - button in "File" menu (1)&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• [Other] Edit statistic file - Ctrl + E or button in "File" menu (1)&lt;LineBreak /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Cambria" FontSize="24" Name="timer"&gt;&lt;Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;&lt;TextDecoration Location="Underline" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;Timer function&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph&gt;&lt;Image Source="{x:Null}" Stretch="UniformToFill" StretchDirection="DownOnly" Name="EmbImage1" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;The core function of this program is of course the timer function. Current time is allways displayed on the main timer display (2). There are two timers, first is the Inspection timer, which countdowns to zero from time assigned by value in text area (4). Second is the actual Solving timer, which is basically a stopwatch, counting up from zero.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;Starting and stopping the timers is realized by pressing the space key. Once you press it, the following timer gets ready and you set it off by releasing the space key. The phase section (3) holds 4 steps of the solving process. The current one is allways marked by a surrounding red box.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;First step says "Scramble the cube". This means the application is ready to measure. In this stage, you can adjust all of the settings and access all the additional functions. It is of course the time you should scramble your puzzle or receive the scrambled puzzle.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;When you press the space key, the phase advances to second step, which is "Inspection Time". Releasing the space key will set off the countdown. When the Inspection time reaches 8 seconds, a voice prompt will tell you, just like on the actual competition. When it reaches 3 seconds, you will hear three consecutive beeps, like when a car race starts, followed by a higher beep, indicating that the Inspection timer ran out. Pressing the space key before the countdown reaches zero or letting the time run out will advance the phase to the third step, "Solving the cube".&lt;LineBreak /&gt;When you release the space key or your Inspection time runs out, the solving timer sets off. When you solve the puzzle, press the space key to stop the timer and to advance to the last step.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;The Last step indicates that you finished solving. Your solve time is passed to the statistic section (reffer to chapter "Statistics") and if the function is on, new scamble is automatically generated (reffer to chapter "Scramble generator"). To reset to scramble phase, hit the space key again.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;To adjust the inspection time, use the text area (4) next to "Inspection Time". Enter the time in seconds, from 0 to 255. Notice that if you put 3 or less, the beeping is disabled.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;Unchecking one of the triggers (5) and (6) will disable the resepective timer. If you wish to use only one of them, the other one will be simply skipped.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;By pressing R anytime while solving, the phase will reset to scrambling phase and all of the timers will stop.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Cambria" FontSize="24" Name="scrambler"&gt;&lt;Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;&lt;TextDecoration Location="Underline" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;Scramble generator&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;The program comes with a built-in scramble generator. You can generate the scramble by pressing the button (10). To adjust the lenght of the scramble (number of steps), please use the text area (11) and enter the desired number. You select the puzzle in "Select puzzle" menu (1), current puzzle is allways checked. Last important part of the scramble generator is trigger (12). When checked, the generator will allways create a new scramble when you reach the final phase (reffer to "Timer function" chapter). Also, it will insert the previous algorithm to the statistic info of your current solve time (reffer to "Statistics" chapter).&lt;LineBreak /&gt;When you enter the application or switch to another puzzle type, new scramble is allways generated for you.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;&lt;Italic&gt;Technical information:&lt;/Italic&gt; The scramble generator uses one instance of .NET's class Random to generate the scrambles. The numbers are allways generated preciselly, so that every possible move has equal chance to be included into the current step. It should not create scrambles that lead into cycles, however, in some extreme cases, it might do it. If described situation happens, please regenerate yourself a new scramble.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Cambria" FontSize="24" Name="stats"&gt;&lt;Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;&lt;TextDecoration Location="Underline" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;Statistics&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;The program comes with very advanced statistics. This chapter will explain how the statistics work and how they are captured. To view the statistics press button (8), reffer to chapter "Statistics - view" for the explanation. Saving and operations with files is explained in chapter "Statistics - saving". The application also comes with editor of the statistic files, this is explained in chapter "Other".&lt;LineBreak /&gt;The statistic system relies on "statistic items", which are often reffered as "Stats" in the application. When you reach the final phase of the solving process (reffer to chapter "Timer function"), new stat is created. It consists of two parts, The solving time and the info. When a stat gets displayed, it tells the solving time and the info, which is a text information about the solving time.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;When new stat is created, the application automatically generates the info text. First part is the puzzle type, which is taken from "Select puzzle" menu (1), reffer to "Scramble generator" chapter for more info. Second part is the date when the solve was done. Third part is optional and includes the scrambling algorithm, and the program will include it if the trigger (12) is checked, again, reffer to "Scramble generator" chapter.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;In the statistic area (7), you can see multiple statistics. In the brackets behind the header, you can see the count of the stats. First statistic is "Last", which displays the lastly generated statistic item, you should be able to see the solving time and a preview of the info, it's lenght depends on the size of the window. The other statistics are aligned into two columns, and they are calculated from solving times of statistic items.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;• Best, Worst - display basically the best and worst soving times from your items&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• Average, Median - arithmetic average and median from the solving times, calculated the standard way&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• Avg of Last 5, Best avg of 5 - Averages from groups of consecutive 5 items. Best shows the average of the best group, last shows average of last group&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• Avg of Last 3of5, Best avg of 3of5 - Averages from groups of consecutive 5 items, where best and worst items are cut. Best shows the average of the best group, last shows average of last group&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• Avg of Last 10, Best avg of 10 - Averages from groups of consecutive 10 items. Best shows the average of the best group, last shows average of last group&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• Avg of Last 10of12, Best avg of 10of12 - Averages from groups of consecutive 12 items, where best and worst items are cut. Best shows the average of the best group, last shows average of last group&lt;LineBreak /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Cambria" FontSize="24" Name="statsview"&gt;&lt;Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;&lt;TextDecoration Location="Underline" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;Statistics - view&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;By pressing the Button (8), a new window will open. This window displays all of the statistic items (reffer to "Statistics" chapter), in the order they were added.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph&gt;&lt;Image Source="{x:Null}" Stretch="UniformToFill" StretchDirection="DownOnly" Name="Image2" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;As you can see, the stats are aligned to one column, and you can see full info for every one. However, this window has one more function than to display the items. In the background, you can see that I made a mistake and stopped the timer by error when picking up the cube. This time ruins the statistics.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph&gt;&lt;Image Source="{x:Null}" Stretch="UniformToFill" StretchDirection="DownOnly" Name="Image3" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;When you scroll to bottom of the list, you can see that there is the Last Stat delete button - 13.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;When you press this button or Delete on your keyboard, you will be prompted to delete the last stat. Remember to allways do this right after you make a mistake, because you can delete stats only in the opposite order that they were added.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;Remember that this is an quick function built in for purpose of deleting those accidentally generated stats. For proper editing of statistic files, please use the statistic file editor, reffer to chapter "Other" for more information.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Cambria" FontSize="24" Name="statssave"&gt;&lt;Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;&lt;TextDecoration Location="Underline" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;Statistics - saving&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph&gt;&lt;Image Source="{x:Null}" Stretch="UniformToFill" StretchDirection="DownOnly" Name="EmbImage2" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;This chapter explains saving and loading of stats, the file and the filesystem structure and the related functions provided by the app.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;The statistic file structure is very simple. To view and edit it, please use the editor, reffer to chapter "Other" for more information. Extension of the statistic file is .stxt. Each Line in the file contains one stat. The line itself contains three parts: solving time, stat info and comment. First two parts are standard parts of the statistic item (reffer to chapter "Statistics").&lt;LineBreak /&gt;The comment is a third part which doesn't belong to the stat, but to the line with the stat, and can hold some information about the line itself. The application doesn't put any comments to lines and also doesn't display them (that is the purpose of info). The comments are fully available in the editor.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;All the statistic files are kept in one folder, the user data folder. Default path to this folder is c:\Users\USER_NAME\Documents\RubikTimer\, which can be changed. The application doesn't notice any files outside this folder. The current file name is allways displayed in the info text at the bottom of the statistic area (7). If the file isn't loaded, the info text will turn red and display a warning, because the statistics can't be saved.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;The application loads the current file when started. When you load another file (explained below), the stats reset. Keep your eyes on the infotext, because the statistic file might haven't been loaded properly. This can have multiple reasons, The file might have been deleted, moved to another folder, it also can be opened and used by another process at the moment. If you changed the location of the folder (explained below), make sure it's in a directory to which you have standard access, so that you don't violate the access rules (do not put it into f.e. Program Files, Program Files (x86), Windows, Users). When you attempt to load the file manually (explained below) and the load fails, the prompt will tell you the reason (Windows's message in the language of your system).&lt;LineBreak /&gt;Automatic save happens when you exit the application, when you open the view window (reffer to chapter "Statistics - view") and when you launch the editor (reffer to chapter "Other"). Manual saving is of course available as well, it's explained below.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;All the filesystem functions are avalailable in the "File" menu (1). You can also see some additional functions, reffer to chapter "Other" for more information. "Exit" will close the application and "Edit statistic files" will launch the editor. Also, by selecting "Open the User data folder", the user data folder gets opened in windows file explorer.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;One of the filesystem functions is loading the configuration file. This makes sure you allways get the application in the state you left it in. Also, the location of the user data folder path and the current file. Please do not delete the config file to prevent errors.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• If you want to switch to another statistic file, you have two options: "Select another statistic file" or "create new statistic file". If you choose to select, you will be prompted with a list of available files to choose from. If you choose to create, you will be promted to enter a name for the new file. After you respond to prompt, the picked file will be loaded. If something fails, the program will tell you the reason (explained above). If the file wasn't loaded, you can try again with the select function. The statistics get reset when you pick different file for saving them.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• If you want to change the location of the user data folder, choose "Change user data folder". You will be prompted to select a directory from your computer. The target directory doesn't have to be empty, and can have any name. Just make sure to select a diectory that you have proper access to. Logical way is to pick a subdirectory of your Documents folder, but it's not necessary to. When you pick the desired folder, the program will move all of the statistic files from the old folder into the new one. If the old directory is empty after this operation, it will be deleted, otherwise, it will remain on the disc to prevent data loss.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;• If you want to disable saving the statistic to files, please click "Don't save statistics to file", so that there appears a tick mark next to this option. The info text will then inform you that the statistic logging is just temporary. The file gets saved and unloaded, but the stats will be kept loaded. From this moment, every time you lauch the app, you will start with blank statistics.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;When you turn the saving back on (click the option again), you will notice that the info text will say that there is no file loaded. You will automatically be prompted to select some file, however if there isn't any, please select "Create a new statistic file" to make one.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Cambria" FontSize="24" Name="other"&gt;&lt;Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;&lt;TextDecoration Location="Underline" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;Other&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;This chapter explains some small things, because it would be waste to give each of them a single chapter.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;First one is the exit, the button is located in the "File" menu (1) as well as the standard windows "X" button in the top right corner of the application window. When you exit the application, it saves the configuration to the config file and saves the current statistic file. First of all, you are promted if you really wish to exit. This behavior can be changed by launching the app with command-line argument "/skip" (without the quotes). The saving won't happen if you shutdown the application (f.e. via the Task Manager)!&lt;LineBreak /&gt;The about and help windows both display very useful information about the application. To see the Legal, please open the About window, to get here and so be able to read about every feature of the application. To prevent errors from happening, please do not modify any of the files in the instalation folder.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;Last but not least is the Statistic file editor. It comes as an attached application, however, you should allways open it through this main application. You can access it through the "File" menu (1). You will be prompted a list of files (similar to the one you get when selecting another statistic file, reffer to "Statistics - saving"). When you choose one to be edited, the editor will be launched. Notice that when the editor gets opened, the current statistic file gets unloaded, that is to prevent any data loss. The editor has similar help window to this one, where you can find information about the editor usage.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;We wish you happy time solving with our application :)&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;/FlowDocument&gt;</Document>
