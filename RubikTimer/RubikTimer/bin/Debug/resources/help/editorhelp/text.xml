For the actual editing of those files, reffer to chapter "Editing".&lt;LineBreak /&gt;The statistics are made of "statistic items", which are saved to the file from the main timer application. With this editor, you can edit these files. A statistic item is composed of two parts - the solving time and the info about this time. Each of those items are then written to one line in the statistic file. The extension of statistic files is ".stxt".&lt;LineBreak /&gt;The line in the statistic file can contain a statistic item, however, it can also contain some text. This means that there are two types of line content: "Statistic" or "Line comment". This is how you will see them in the editor.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;If the line contains a comment, it is just one text string. If it contains a statistic item, there are three parts - the solve time, the info and the comment. Comment is like a line comment, except it is behind the info on the same line as the statistic item. Both type of comments are ignored by the main timer application, but you can include some "hidden info" into them. The main applications preserves the line comments in the exact spot in the files, so you don't loose them.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Cambria" FontSize="24" Name="edit"&gt;&lt;Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;&lt;TextDecoration Location="Underline" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;Statistics&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph&gt;&lt;Image Source="{x:Null}" Stretch="UniformToFill" StretchDirection="DownOnly" Name="EmbImage1" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;The core function of the editor is described in this chapter. You can see the lines (3) of the file visualized in the grid of the editor. First column says what line contents does the line hold. Second and third columns are only for Statistics, and they display the solve time and the info. Fourth column displays the comment and the fifth column contains the delete button for the line.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;In the header line (2), there are buttons, which will order the lines (3) by comparing the values of the column you clicked. Button in header of the column with delete buttons will order the lines back to the original order, the order they were added in chronologically.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;You can edit only the info and comment values, simply by double clicking the cell you wish to edit and rewriting the contents. This is the primary use of the editor, adding new information to infos and comments.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;If some line in the file is marked as a statistic line but doesn't contain any statistic, the editor will show that the line contents is "Invalid statistic line". When you click on invalid line, a button will show. By clicking it, the line gets converted to Line comment.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;To add a new line comment, click the add line button (4) and write the desired text.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;When you finish editing, you should save the file, so that your changes take place. The files are allways saved to the directory you opened them from, which means the default user data folder of the main application. Saving the files is done through options in the "File" menu (1). Save will save the information to the original file. Save as will prompt you to enter a name for the new file, and then creates new file, to which the information is saved. The original file remains as it was when you loaded it in.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Cambria" FontSize="24" Name="other"&gt;&lt;Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;&lt;TextDecoration Location="Underline" /&gt;&lt;/Paragraph.TextDecorations&gt;Other&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;This chapter explains some small things, because it would be waste to give each of them a single chapter.&lt;LineBreak /&gt;First one is the exit, the button is located in the "File" menu (1) as well as the standard windows "X" button in the top right corner of the application window. When you exit the application and the changes have not been saved, you are prompted to save. If you choose to do so, the save function is used and so the original file gets saved (reffer to chapter "Editing"). The application closes normally after this check. If you shutdown the editor (f.e. via TaskManager), all unsaved changes will be lost!&lt;LineBreak /&gt;The about and help windows both display very useful information about the application. To see the Legal, please open the About window, to get here and so be able to read about every feature of the application. To prevent errors from happening, please do not modify any of the files in the instalation folder.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;Paragraph FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="16"&gt;Happy editing! :)&lt;/Paragraph&gt;&lt;/FlowDocument&gt;</Document>
